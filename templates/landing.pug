                | &#32;is a role playing game developed by the Delta Green Partnership. Delta Green is
                | also a conspiracy. It works in the shadows, within governments and other
                | organizations to make sure that knowledge of the Mythos doesn't leak out.
                | Sometimes, Delta Green agents are even able to save people while accomplishing
                | their primary mission.

                | This tool is intended as a resource for players and handlers alike. My hope
                | is that it will provide ready-made characters for sessions of all sorts.
