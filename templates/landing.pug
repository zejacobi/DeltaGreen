                    | &#32;is a role playing game developed by the Delta Green Partnership. Delta Green is
                    | also a conspiracy. It works in the shadows, within governments and other
                    | organizations to make sure that knowledge of the Mythos doesn't leak out.
                    | Sometimes, Delta Green agents are even able to save people while accomplishing
                    | their primary mission.
                p
                    | This tool is intended as a resource for players and handlers alike. My hope
                    | is that it will provide ready-made characters for sessions of all sorts.

                    | Once you're in Delta Green, there's no way out. The only retirement plan the
